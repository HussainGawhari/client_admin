(1) Client Form Submission Completion:
I've successfully implemented the client form submission feature. This likely involved capturing input data from the user through a form and handling the submission process. 

(2) Adding Client to Database:
I've implemented the backend API endpoint to handle the creation of new clients. When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the backend, and a new client entry is added to the database.

(3) List of Clients in Table:
I've achieved the functionality to retrieve a list of clients from the backend API and display them in a table format in frontend application.
